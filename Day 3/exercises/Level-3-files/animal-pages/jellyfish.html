                    Jellyfish are aquatic animals that are found in oceans all around the world. They are known for their gelatinous, translucent bodies and trailing tentacles, which can be used for capturing prey and for defense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jellyfish come in many different shapes and sizes, from tiny species that are only a few millimeters in diameter to larger species that can be over six feet across. Most jellyfish have a bell-shaped body with trailing tentacles, which contain stinging cells called nematocysts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jellyfish are carnivorous and feed on small fish, plankton, and other aquatic organisms. They use their tentacles to capture their prey and then bring it to their mouth, which is located on the underside of their bell-shaped body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jellyfish are passive swimmers and are primarily carried along by ocean currents. They are also able to regulate their buoyancy by contracting and relaxing their muscles, allowing them to float at different depths in the water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some species of jellyfish are capable of bioluminescence, which is the ability to produce light. This is thought to be used for attracting prey or for defense. While jellyfish are not typically considered dangerous to humans, some species can cause painful stings. It is important to avoid contact with jellyfish if possible and to seek medical attention if stung.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jellyfish are important members of marine ecosystems and play a role in the food chain as both predators and prey. However, some species are considered invasive and can disrupt ecosystems where they are not native. Conservation efforts are underway to better understand jellyfish populations and their role in the marine environment.
