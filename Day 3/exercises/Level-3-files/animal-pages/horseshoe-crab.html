                Horseshoe crabs are a group of marine arthropods that are not true crabs but are more closely related
                to spiders and scorpions. They have been around for over 450 million years, making them one of the oldest
                species on Earth and one of the few living fossils. Horseshoe crabs have a distinctive horseshoe-shaped exoskeleton,
                which protexts their body and provides them with a streamlined shape to help them move through the water.
              </p>
              <p>
                Horseshoe crabs are found primarily in the Atlantic Ocean along the coasts of North America, but they can also be found
                in the Gulf of Mexico and in the waters of Southeast Asia. These creatures are known for their unique reproductive behavior, in
                which females lay eggs in the sand and males fertilize them. During the mating season, huge numbers of horseshoe crabs can be found
                along the shore, which makes for an amazing sight.
              </p>
              <p>
                Horseshoe crabs play an important role in the ecosystem, as they are a primary food source for migratory shorebirds, such as red knots,
                that rely on their eggs for sustenance during their long journeys. In addition, their blue blood contains a substance called Limulus amebocyte
                lysate (LAL), which is used to test for bacterial endotoxins in medical equipment and vaccines. Horseshoe crabs are also used as bait in eel and
                conch fishing, and their exoskeletons are used as fertilizer and in construction. Despite their importance, horseshoe crab populations have declined
                in recent years due to habitat loss and over-harvesting, making it important to conserve and protect these ancient creatures.
